# Reproducible Research Course 2026

Many materials and rules come from last year’s materials prepared by [Wojciech Hardy, PhD](https://www.acep.uw.edu.pl/hardy/reproducible-research/rr-materials-2425/) and [Jakub Michańków, PhD](https://github.com/jmichankow/reproducible_research_2025).

## Course rules 
1. **Activity** (50 pts.):
    - DataCamp two tracks: [Git Fundamentals](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/git-fundamentals), [GitHub Foundations](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/github-foundations) and two courses ([Introduction to Docker](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-docker) and [Intermediate Docker](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-docker))
2. **Final project** (30 pts.) + **Presentation** (20 pts.)

### Final Project (30 pts.) [[1]](https://hackmd.io/@WHardy/RR2025#/)

A fully reproducible research project, hosted on GitHub, demonstrating your understanding of the course concepts.

1. project stored in a repository from the start (visible history of well-described contributions from all team members who collaborate) (7.5 pp.)
2. code and results with appropriate documentation (e.g. Markdown) appropriate for full reproducibility (7.5 pp.)
3. code in a clean and user-friendly format (7.5 pp.)
4. reproducible environment with Docker (including Dockerfile/docker-compose.yaml and image deployed to Docker Hub) (7.5 pp.)



### Presentation (20 pts.) [[2]](https://hackmd.io/@WHardy/RR2025#/)
- Groups of 3 people.  If you can't find a team by the time of the deadline, you will be assigned to a team.
- Last two-three meetings of the course will be devoted to the presentations.
- The presentations should last app. 20 minutes, include all team members and briefly go over:
    - what the project is about, how it was done, how it works, etc.
    - include a short presentation of the code as well.
- The projects will be run from a computer in the lab, after pulling them from a GitHub repository.
